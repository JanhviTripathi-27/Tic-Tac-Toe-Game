# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
A simple and fun Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s a two-player game where Player X and Player O take turns marking spaces in a 3×3 grid. The first player to align three marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
This project is a great example of using DOM manipulation, game logic, and event handling in JavaScript.
